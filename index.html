        <p>Hello, my name is Jean Andrade and I am from Venezuela, passionate about technology and continuous learning. I am greatly motivated to share my enthusiasm for technology as a technician, instructor, and developer. Besides my love for technology, I share my life with my lovely wife. Through my service in the Church, as a seminary teacher, and in missionary preparation programs, I have strengthened my commitment, purpose, and sense of service. My constant pursuit of growth and development encompasses professional, spiritual and personal aspects</p>
